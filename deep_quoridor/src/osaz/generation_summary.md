# Implementation of OpenSpiel AlphaZero Agent

This document captures the conversation and implementation steps for creating the OpenSpiel AlphaZero agent files according to the requirements.

## Requirements

The implementation needed to follow these requirements from `osaz.requirements.md`:

1. Generate everything in an osaz directory
2. Generate different pieces of code incrementally 
3. All files should have a main function callable from the command line
4. Follow linter requirements, including no trailing blank spaces
5. First implement tictactoe.py with MCTS agent vs random agent in Tic Tac Toe
6. Then implement quoridor.py for the Quoridor game

## Implementation Process

### Initial Steps

1. Deleted the existing osaz directory
2. Viewed the requirements in `osaz.requirements.md`
3. Created a new osaz directory

### Implementation of tictactoe.py

Created a Python script for playing Tic Tac Toe with:
- OpenSpiel framework
- MCTSBot as player 0
- UniformRandomBot as player 1
- RandomRolloutEvaluator for the MCTS bot
- Command-line interface with flags for configuration
- Game result statistics

### Implementation of quoridor.py

Modified the Tic Tac Toe implementation to:
- Use Quoridor as the game
- Add game-specific parameters (board size, number of players, wall count)
- Enhance action decoding to provide human-readable descriptions of Quoridor moves
- Include negative reward handling (as learned from a previous DQN implementation)

### Debugging and Fixing Issues

Several issues were encountered and fixed:

1. Removed incorrect `simple_plotlib` import
2. Fixed the MCTSBot constructor parameters to avoid duplicating the evaluator
3. Switched to using OpenSpiel's built-in RandomRolloutEvaluator
4. Fixed parameter types in quoridor.py (converting strings to integers)
5. Corrected the parameter name from "walls_per_player" to "wall_count"

### Code Quality Improvements

The user improved code quality by:
1. Reorganizing imports
2. Fixing whitespace and indentation
3. Following code formatting best practices
4. Improving multi-line statements

## Final Result

The implementation provides two working game agents:
1. An MCTS agent playing against a random agent in Tic Tac Toe
2. An MCTS agent playing against a random agent in Quoridor

Both can be executed from the command line with various configuration options, and both show detailed gameplay information and statistics.
